Strange feeling in my chest. 
A little bit to the left side.

I think my heart is skipping a beat.
Pump. Pause. Pump. Pause.
Strange feeling.
Like I was placed at slingshot's leatherpad,
then invisible hand shot me upwards.
My inner chest felt hollow on the way up.
My inner chest got vacuumed on the way down.

Did I give my heart away?
Or maybe I had too much coffee.
